## Interaction Analysis: Classroom Session

**Teacher:** All right. So I want you to raise your hand and answer this question. The question is: how do you normally pay for things? In cash or by credit or debit card? 

**Teacher:**  VC is raising her hand. Let's bring VC up.

**Teacher:** Hi VC.

**Student:** Is it only me?

**Teacher:** It's just you so far. Yeah.

**Student:** Ah, okay.

**Teacher:**  So, um¡K Yeah, but first, how are you today?

**Student:** How do I normally pay for things? 

**Student:** Great, super busy.

**Teacher:** All right. That's enough small talk. So, how do you normally pay for things? In cash or by credit or debit card? 

**Student:**  I normally just pay by credit cards. Um, if it¡¦s possible, I just pay it by digital payments on my phone. But, uh, cash is still important as well, because not all the stores that you can pay by your digital payments or credit cards.

**Teacher:** Ah, okay.

**Student:**  So it's still vital. You should bring your cash. 

**Teacher:** Cash is still vital. Um, is, do you think that's across all of Taiwan or just in, in your city?

**Student:** It's across over Taiwan.

**Teacher:** Got it. 

**Student:** Mm.

**Teacher:**  All right. And what do you generally need cash for?

**Student:** Um, maybe you will need to send a package in the post office, or you want to buy something, snacks, from a vendor.

**Teacher:**  Perfect. All right. That's a great answer. Would you like to just read it again? I made a few small changes. 

**Student:** Okay. I usually pay via digital payments whenever I can, but I also sometimes pay by credit card or my credit cards. 

**Teacher:**  Um, we say "pay by credit card", um even if you use more than one credit card because it's a form of payment. Uh, we just say "by credit card", like by cash, by credit card. We just use it in the singular form.

**Student:** The cash is uncountable, whereas credit cards is countable?

**Teacher:** True. No, no, you're right, you're right. That's true. Um, we just say "pay by credit card". We never pluralize it, even if you use more than one credit card.  Okay.

**Student:** Uh, cash is still vital across all of Taiwan. You might need cash to send a package or buy some snakes from a vendor.

**Teacher:** Good.  Um

**Teacher:**  Um, don't say uh, "snakes", it's "snacks".  Ah, snacks.

**Student:** Snacks.

**Teacher:**  Snacks. Good. Snacks. You shouldn't buy snakes because they might bite you. You might become their snack.

**Student:**  I thought it pronounced the snake. 

**Teacher:** No.  Snack.

**Student:** Snack.  Okay.

**Teacher:** Yep. All right, well done. Thanks for your answer, VC, good job and uh, I will mute you.  Cheers.

**Student:** Thanks.

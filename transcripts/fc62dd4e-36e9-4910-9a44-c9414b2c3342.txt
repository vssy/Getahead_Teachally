<p>Teacher: All right. So I want you to raise your hand and answer this question. The question is how do you normally pay for things in cash or by credit or debit card? </p>
<p>Teacher: VC is raising a hand, let's bring VC up. Hey VC. Is it only me? </p>
<p>Student:  It's just you so far, yeah. </p>
<p>Student: Uh Okay. </p>
<p>Teacher: So, how do you normally pay for things? </p>
<p>Teacher: Yeah, but first, how are you today? </p>
<p>Student: Great! Super busy! </p>
<p>Teacher: All right, that's enough small talk. So how do you normally pay for things in cash or by credit or debit card?  </p>
<p>Student: I normally just pay by credit cards and if it's possible I just pay it by digital payments on my phone but uh cash is still important as well because not all the stores that you can pay by your digital payments or credit cards. So it's still vital you should bring your cash.</p>
<p>Teacher: Ah, Okay. Cash is still vital um is do you think that's across all of Taiwan or just in in your city?  </p>
<p>Student:  All is across over Taiwan. </p>
<p>Teacher: Got it. Um All right and what do you generally need cash for?  </p>
<p>Student: Um maybe you need to send a package in the post office or you want to buy something snacks from a vendor.  </p>
<p>Teacher: Perfect, all right that's a great answer. Would you like to just read it again? I made a few small changes.  </p>
<p>Student: Okay. I usually pay by digital payments whenever I can but I also sometimes pay by credit card.  </p>
<p>Teacher: Why not credit cards? </p>
<p>Student:  Um we say pay by credit card um even if you use more than one credit card because it's a form of payment uh we just say by credit card like by cash, by credit card. We just use it in the singular form. </p>
<p>Teacher: Cash is uncountable whereas credit cards is countable. </p>
<p>Student:  True. </p>
<p>Teacher: No no you're right you're right that's true. Um we just say pay by credit card we never pluralize it even if you use more than one credit card. </p>
<p>Student:  Okay. </p>
<p>Student: Cash is still vital across all of Taiwan. You might need cash to send a package or buy some snakes from a vendor.  </p>
<p>Teacher: Good. Um Don't say uh snakes it's snacks. Ah snacks. </p>
<p>Student:  Snacks. </p>
<p>Teacher: Snacks good. Snake you shouldn't buy snakes because they might bite you, you might become their snack. </p>
<p>Student:  I thought it pronounced the snake. </p>
<p>Teacher: No.  </p>
<p>Student: Snacks. Okay. </p>
<p>Teacher: Yep. All right, well done, thanks for your answer VC. Good job and uh I will mute you. Cheers. </p>
<p>Student:  Thanks. </p>
